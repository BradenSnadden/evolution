The writing portions of the assignment have been split between group members, similar to the coding portions.
Each group member was tasked with small parts of each question such that experience can be gained.

Ajeendra:
    Ajeendra programmed the insert mutation, along with the order crossover.
    The UML diagram under part 4 was also Ajeendras responsibility, along with a majority of the writing for part 4.

Alec:
    Alec was given the task of completing part 6, which involved reading from a file and saving the cities provided in a numpy array.
    The writing of part 10 was partially Alecs responsibility.

Braden:
    Braden implemented the population and individual classes, collaborating with Alec to ensure that formatting and data types remained the same.
    The writing of parts 3 and 4 were also contributed to by Braden.

Henry:
    Henry was tasked with implementing the swap mutation, along with the Partially Mapped Crossover functions. He also completed the implementation of
    inver-over for part 11 and wrote it's results. He also programed the plots and created all 4 of the co-ordinate diagrams for part 10.

Ryan:
    Ryan split tasks 8 and 9 with the other group members, specifically the scramble mutation and edge recombination functions.
    Ryan also helped with alot of the writing in parts 10.

Kaijun:
    Kaijun, similar to Ryan, split tasks 8 and 9 with the other group members, taking command of the inversion and cycle crossover implementations.
    Kaijunm also co wrote significant parts of the text in parts 10.
